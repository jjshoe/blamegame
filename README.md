blamegame
=========
Blame game was written to satisfy an ANGRY CEO when ever he would come to my desk and ask who broke something.
All you do is provide it a file name and a code snippet you want to find any history of changes for.

```
Usage:
    blame_game.pl [options] <file> <code>

    Options: 
      -help: brief help message 
      -d: pass the value of old if you want to search old to new
```
